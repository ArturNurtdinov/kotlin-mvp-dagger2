Kotlin’s popularity is growing day by day. Many  libraries, documents and other resources have already published with Kotlin. We may check the list with a simple search of ’awesome Kotlin’.

So, this application will cover two design patterns: MVP and Dependency Injection. You may heard typicode, was used as server. It will be abstracted by using Retrofit and RxJava2 will be used to make requests it as observables which is another hot topic for mobile development.
