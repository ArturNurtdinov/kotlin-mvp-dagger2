Kotlin’s popularity is growing day by day. Many  libraries, documents and other resources have already published with Kotlin. We may check the list with a simple search of ’awesome Kotlin’.

This is an example application that I wanted to use Kotlin with Dagger2, Rx and Retrofit. You may heard typicode, was used a json server.
